        codes that allow them to be stored.</p>

      <h3>ASCII character set</h3>
      <p>
        The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set is one of the most common
        character sets.
        </br>
        In 1963, it became the standard character code used by computers.
        </br>
        </br>
        ASCII was originally a 7-bit character code, which means there are 2⁷ = 128 different characters represented by
        this character set.
        </br>
        </br>
        There are 32 control codes for the first 32 characters, which are used as in-band signaling to cause different
        effects.
        </br>
        ASCII also has 26 upper case characters, 26 lower case characters, and the numeric digits 0 to 9.
        </br>
        It also has a total of 32 punctuation codes, symbols and a space button.
      </p>

      <h3>Extended ASCII character set</h3>
      <p>
        The extended ASCII character set is a 8-bit character set, which means there are 2⁸ = 256 different characters
        represented by this character set.
        </br>
        </br>
        This allows for the representation of an additional 128 characters. This allows special characters from
        different languages, such as characters with accents, to be shown.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Unicode character set</h3>
      <p>
        As ASCII only can represent a maximum of 256 characters, the Unicode character set is used as it can use up to
        16 bits of memory to represent over 65 thousand characters.
        </br>
        </br>
        This allows characters and symbols from different languages, such as Chinese or Arabic, to be represented as
        well.
        </br>
        </br>
        Because the first 128 characters in Unicode use the same numeric codes as ASCII, Unicode is compatible with
        ASCII.
