hi this was done for a school assignment

if the content is a bit inaccurate to the a-level computing syllabus, i'm sorry it's because i don't hv a textbook or an o-lvl computing background

ps: i think the colours page is the coolest of them all :P

pps: this is my first computing website that actually has pretty neat ccs... what a shocker! had to mod the rest to be prettier lolz
